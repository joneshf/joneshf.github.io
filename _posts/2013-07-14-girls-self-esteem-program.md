So, yesterday I did an event with this program to help young girls.
They seemed like a really good group.
From what I understand, they host a yearly program from March to September.
They accept girls from ages 4-18.
The program teaches these girls how to become adults basically.
When I say that, I mean that the focus seems to be, "How to be a good person."
The program is to help girls with their self-esteem, personal image and whatnot.

...

I've lost my train of thought.
